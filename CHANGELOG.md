## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phases 1-10 (Agent OS Roadmap)

- **Phase 1: API detail endpoints** — `GET /api/tools/{name}`, `GET /api/profiles/{name}`, `GET /api/a2a/agents/{id}` for single-item lookups
- **Phase 2: Cron CRUD completion** — `PUT /api/cron/jobs/{id}` for in-place job editing; CLI `openfang cron update` aligned
- **Phase 3: Rich comms_send** — `thread_id` and file/media `attachments` on `/api/comms/send`; channel-target delivery mode; JavaScript and Python SDK updates
- **Phase 4: MCP server CRUD API** — `POST /api/mcp/servers`, `PUT /api/mcp/servers/{name}`, `DELETE /api/mcp/servers/{name}` for runtime MCP management
- **Phase 5: Backup and restore** — `POST /api/backup`, `GET /api/backups`, `DELETE /api/backups/{filename}`, `POST /api/restore` with ZIP archives, manifest validation, and atomic writes
- **Phase 6: Deterministic hand identity** — UUID v5 stable instance IDs across daemon restarts; hand state persistence
- **Phase 7: Builtin router** — deterministic rule-based goal routing to Hands, workflows, and specialist agents without LLM dependency
- **Phase 8: Capability registry for routing** — `GET /api/routing/capabilities` exposing Hands, workflows, and agents as routable capabilities with keyword-based matching
- **Phase 9: User-in-the-loop agent builder** — capability-gap analysis, reviewable proposals (agent/workflow/hand), approval-backed creation via `POST /api/routing/proposals` and `POST /api/routing/proposals/apply`; Dashboard Builder page; TUI Builder tab; CLI builder commands
- **Phase 10: Extensions API** — Dashboard Extensions tab (browse/install/health); 7 integration management endpoints documented in api-reference.md

### Changed

- `RoutingCapabilityKind` serde serialization normalized to snake_case for API consistency
- `openfang approvals list` now renders the current approvals API object response correctly in human-readable mode
